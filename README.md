</h2>
This is a repository of us 3 team members on this great hackathon organised by GeeksForGeeks.This is data science project has been an exciting journey that blends the power of data science with web development to create an innovative application that combines analytical insights with a user-friendly online interface. We are enthusiastic about showcasing our skills in our domains.We worked on data related to various fields related to environmental concerns such as Carbon footprint analysis, Eco-friendly shopping, and many more.

</h1>

## Project Overview
Introducing the EcoSight  Analytics by our team for the GeeksforGeeks EcoTech Hackathon. Our project combines a carbon footprint calculator, real-time CO2 ppm analysis, emission reduction tips, and environmental news updates, empowering users to make informed decisions for a sustainable future. With interactive visualizations and a technology stack including Python, Django, and HTML,CSS,Javascript our project promotes greener lifestyles and fosters global environmental awareness.
## Team Members
- Shibam Roy: Data Scientist / Back-end developer
- Ankush Roy: Front-end Developer/ UI Designer
- Swadhin Maharana: Data Scientist
## QNA
<h1>1.What our project basically targets to do?</h1>
=> Our project promotes sustainable environmental development and also features multiple applications such as a carbon footprint calculator , so that people are aware of their own carbon emission contributions, Not only does it calculate the carbon emissions it also suggests recommendations on how we can improve ourselves to have a better future!

Our project also has a Satellite image classification model which basically classifies the situation of any satellite image given to it, this will classify the probability of that particular area of having pollution, water, mine etc.
This can be used to identify your locality in a better way.

That's not all, we also analysed the air pollution index data from 2017 to 2022 and drew out multiple helpful insights, you can check the overall analysis too! This also has a predictive model to find out upcoming air pollution indices especially in India, the model isn't available to run in the website but you can run it locally in your computer(instructions are given near the jupyter notebook , or you can check the other questions too)

<h1>2.How can you access our project?</h1>
=> You are already in the correct place, you can view this overall repository to find out our work.

<h1>3.How can you run the Air Pollution Index model?</h1>
=> Our model is there in the AirQuality folder, you can simply download it in your computer, run the python script with it called "runAirQuality.py" , but ensure to have internet connection during the installation procedure(The python script will install a few libraries, make to sure to have python installed in your computer too)
